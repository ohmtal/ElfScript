It needs to be done in "end" 
- [X] add preprocessor with ';' break to lines
- [X] added multiline statement parser and fixed issues with undetected syntax errors - endless loop
- [X] while or similar while(true) loop

## 0.3 

- add some basic SDL3 bindings ;) Test if i can use my ElfScript macros - but i 
don't have to PoD Types here at the moment. 
- [X] setup projecct Simply Added to current CMake
- [X] add some basic bindings
- [X] fixed if statement broken afer while inserted
- [X] added getDouble/getInt for auto type convert
- [X] BinaryExpression::evaluate uses getDouble
- [X] Added else and finally fixed If as BlockStatement - run in a own execute !! .. variables ?!?
- [X] "!=" as compare 
- [X] add a constant system ...
    - true and false added in core
- [X] write the starfield demo in DreiZehn
- [X] test params  => if (math.random 10 20) != 4 print "huhu" end
- [X] need: ||, &&, <=, >=, >>, <<, |, &
- [X] Pointer method calles with Array '->' \o/
- [X] rewrote RunScript .. 
- [X] added Symbols Table for fast lookup variables/functions/constants ....
- [X] optimized a bit found 3 sek on test_var bench ;) 

# 0.4
- [X] VariableFrame for variables and garbage collection
- [X] ValueObject type registry (gUserObjectTypes / registerUserObjectType)
- [X] When a new String is set the old should be deleted!!! ..
    => added an mAssigned flag
- [~] add delete method to ALL object.  .. onMethod must call the parent 
    => let the garbage collection do that - i added the assigned flag. 
- [X] Bytecode 
    - [X] change the direct threading like it is in ElfScript
    - [X] While i port it use the new VariableFrame 
- [X] Better Garbage collection and array also keep track of object assignment
- [X] Before I continue with ByteCode I'll optimize the current code i guess i can get
under 15 sec and beat python here without bytecode ;)
    - [X] Operator ++, --, +=, -=, *=, /= 
    - [X] other BinaryExpression to switch case
- **12.478u 0.002s 0:12.52 99.6%    0+0k 0+0io 0pf+0w** 

# 0.5
- multiline statement for example if..


# future ideas
- [ ] Bytecode continue .... 
- [ ] header only - for easy include 
    - Problem : CallExpression <> FunctionMap < ASTNode
    
- change printf errorf to a overwritable class or add a handler
